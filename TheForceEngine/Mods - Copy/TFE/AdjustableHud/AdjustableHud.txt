This is a built-in Mod based on the work by Paweł "Dzierzan" Dzierżanowski (https://twitter.com/Dzierzan23). The purpose of the mod is to allow the floating HUD elements in Dark Forces to be adjustable - specifically being able to move them away from the edges of the screen for widescreen displays.

Usage of this mod is automatic. The original assets were cut in order to simplify the use in-engine and avoid palette indexing issues. If you plan on using this content for other purposes, please contact the original author first.

* HudStatus*Addon.bm files were generated from the included PNG files.
* Only the bm files are used in-game using the same rendering system as the rest of the HUD.
* This mod works equally well with GPU or software rendering.
